# Amőba Live

This is an online rendition of the Hungarian game, Amőba. It's basically 5-in-a-row Tic-Tac-Toe, played on a larger grid.

This is implemented using Meteor.js.

I am building this as my Capstone project for Coursera's [Full Stack Website Development](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/website-development) specialization.
