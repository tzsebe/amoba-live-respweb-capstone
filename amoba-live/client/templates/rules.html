        <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
        <p>Here, we cover the basic rules of the game, as well as quirks we've added for this site in particular.</p>

        <h3>Rules of Am&#337;ba</h3>
        <p>Very simply put, this is a 2-player, turn-based game. Think of it as "5-in-a-row tic-tac-toe." Players take turns putting tokens on a 2-D grid. The first player to reach five in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), wins the game.</p>

        <h3>Additional Restrictions</h3>
        <p>To help make this game more fast-paced, we've imposed a time limit on the player to make a move. If a move is not made within the time limit of {{moveTimeLimitSeconds}} seconds, the game is closed, and the player whose turn it was loses the game. This restriction does not apply for the first two moves, to ensure that everyone is properly setup.</p>
        <p>If a game has no moves on it for {{abandonedTimeLimitMinutes}} minutes, it is considered abandoned, and no winner is counted.</p>

        <h3>Player Matching</h3>
        <p>To play games, players have to challenge one another. Each player can have ONE active challenge to another player. Once another player accepts the challenge, the game begins immediately. A challenge has an expiration of {{invitationTimeoutMinutes}} minutes, but can be manually refreshed (or changed to a different user) if desired.</p>

        <h3>Other Features</h3>
        <p>Through the game log, players can browse existing games, spectate ongoing games, and even comment in real-time!</p>
        <p>Through the leaderboard, players can see how they rank compared to other players.</p>
